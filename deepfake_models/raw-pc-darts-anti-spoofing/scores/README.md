# Note
score-fixed_mel.txt and score-learnable_linear.txt are present in the repository from the start, i.e. they are generated by the people who created rawpc. 

score-rawpc.txt is generated by running the fixed_mel architecture on the default settings in evaluate.py with the pretrained architecture in ../pretrained/architecture_fix_mel.txt. scores.txt is just the scores from score-rawpc.txt.
